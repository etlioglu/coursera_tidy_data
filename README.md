The "tidy" dataset includes the following files:
- "README.txt" : this file
- "tidy_data.txt" : cleaned and processed data set
- "run_analysis.R" : the R script used to produce the tidy data set
- codebook.txt : list of variables

Analysis overview:
- the test and the training data sets are read as data frames and proper column names are set
- columns providing "mean" and " "standard deviation" are extracted
- two columns, "subject" and "activity" are added to each data frame
- the two data frames are merged into a single data frame
- activity column is changed from codes to explicit activity names
- the data frame is grouped by "subject" and "activity" columns
- group mean values of each of the features (columns) are calculated

Deatiled analysis information is provided in the "run_analysis.R" code file.
